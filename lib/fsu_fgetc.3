.Sh NAME
.Nm fsu_fgetc
.Nd get next character or word from input stream
.Sh LIBRARY
fsu_utils Library (libfsu_utils, \-lfsu_utils)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fsu_utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn fsu_fgetc "FSU_FILE *stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fsu_fgetc
function
obtains the next input character (if present) from the stream pointed at by
.Fa stream .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, this routine returns the next requested object
from the
.Fa stream .
If the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs,
the routines return
.Dv EOF .
The routines
.Xr fsu_feof 3
and
.Xr fsu_ferror 3
must be used to distinguish between end-of-file and error.
If an error occurs, the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
The end-of-file condition is remembered, even on a terminal, and all
subsequent attempts to read will return
.Dv EOF
until the condition is cleared with
.Xr fsu_clearerr 3 .
