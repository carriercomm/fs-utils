.Op Fl t Ar fstype
.Op Fl f
.Ar fsdevice

.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by
each
.Ar directory
argument, provided it is empty, from the
.Ar fstype
file system image contained in
.Ar fsdevice .
.Pp
Arguments are processed in the order given.
In order to remove both a parent directory and a subdirectory
of that parent, the subdirectory
must be specified first so the parent directory
is empty when
.Nm
tries to remove it.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Each
.Ar directory
argument is treated as a pathname of which all
components will be removed, if they are empty,
starting with the last most component.
(See
.Xr fsu_rm 1
for fully non-discriminant recursive removal.)
